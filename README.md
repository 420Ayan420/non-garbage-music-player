# non-garbage-music-player
I am fed up of Spotify not having all the music I want, and having to pay for a YouTube subscription to download .mp3s so that I listen locally if I don't have the music on Spotify. One stop solution to take organize music, take Spotify playlist and download, and directly convert YouTube links to .mp3 to listen locally. More features planned.
